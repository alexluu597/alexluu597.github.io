This was my first big school project and my first time working in a team. 
This felt like I was working in a job because I had to communicate with my team to develop a game for our client. 
There were some problems along the way, but we managed to finish it in a complete state, and our client was happy about it. 
This was a very good learning experience, showing that not everything can go how you want it to, and that you need to make changes during development.

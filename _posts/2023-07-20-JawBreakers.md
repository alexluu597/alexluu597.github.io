This is one of my school projects where I had to create a design document to plan what kind of game I was making. 
I came up with a platform fighting game that is similar to Super Smash Bros., but I made it candy theme. 
Although it's unfinished, it taught me a lot of things from it, like how the planning and development phase goes, how plans change overtime, and much more.
